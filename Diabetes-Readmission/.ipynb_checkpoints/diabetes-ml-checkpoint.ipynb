    "### Project Overview\n",
    "This project analyzes ten years (1999–2008) of clinical care data from 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. The dataset focuses on diabetic patients who received inpatient care—including lab work, medications, and short hospital stays (up to 14 days). The goal is to predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters\n",
    "Think of it like this: If someone with diabetes goes to the hospital and is sent home too early or without the right care, they might get worse and have to come back. That’s bad for their health and expensive for everyone involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research helps us figure out how to prevent that from happening in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we know how to improve outcomes for diabetic patients, many still don’t receive proper care during their hospital stay. This project aims to highlight patterns in the data that can be used to flag high-risk patients before discharge—so hospitals can intervene early and reduce unnecessary readmissions.\n",
